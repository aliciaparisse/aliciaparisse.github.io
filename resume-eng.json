    "summary": "My name is Alicia Parisse and I am an student finishing her Computer Science Engineering studies in INSA de Lyon. I come from a background where I studied more general science and discovered Computer Science during my studies. Since then I have been passioned with web programming and tried to improve my skills in this field. But what makes me different is that I am a passionate person and I akways want to learn more. <br/><br/> During my studies I got involved with multiple associations, being the President of the Computer Science Student Association. I had to master manager skills to lead my team and make events a great experience for the students. I have been feeling like home in the Computer Science World as it is an open-minded world that always wants to get better and to learn more. <br/><br/> But as a woman working in Computer Science, I discovered that there was only a few of us in this world. I found myself being a feminist and fighting for the right of girls to know about Computer Science as a world where they are welcome. <br/><br> As I said, I am a passionate person, as well for my work as for my life. I will always work hard for the things I believe in, be it gender equality or my company.",
