# Elegant Theme - modified version by Alicia Parisse

Responsive theme for [JsonResume](https://jsonresume.org/) inspired by card layouts.

[Theme Preview](http://themes.jsonresume.org/elegant) for the original version

This is only a fork of the github repo from mudassir0909, that you can find in [this place](https://github.com/mudassir0909/jsonresume-theme-elegant).
This is for my personal use so I can't assure you of the fact that it will work with your resume.

You can still contribute to the original repo, so I left the instructions here.

### Contributing
```
$ git clone https://github.com/mudassir0909/jsonresume-theme-elegant.git
$ cd jsonresume-theme-elegant
$ npm install
$ grunt watch // watches for less file changes
$ grunt exec:run_server // Do this in a new terminal tab to run node server
```
